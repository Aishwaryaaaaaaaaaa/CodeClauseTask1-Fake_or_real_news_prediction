# CodeClauseTask1-Fake_or_real_news_prediction
In this project i have used several libraries such as NumPy , Pandas , Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze the data.

The project involve several processes such as Data Pre-processing ,Distribution Of classes , Exploratory Data Analysis , Visualisation through heatmaps , plotting word cloud , stemming , splitting the data into training and testing data.

After preprocessing the data , I used Logistic Regression Algorithm to build a predictive model.The model was trained using the training data and then i evaluated its performance on the test data.

Overall , this project aimed to detect fake or real news out of a dataset and build a predictive model for detecting fake or real news.
